BDLI 
Hello my name is Dorathy Christopher. I'm a student of Bonny Digital Literacy Initiative. I want to briefly talk about BDLI 
Bonny Digital Literacy Initiative is a technology driven initiative powered by Technoville Innovation Nigeria whose aim is to empower youth development in technology and entrepreneurship.
BDLI program is designed to help youth enhance skills and gain valuable knowledge in Tech field and also provide youth with expert guidance through out the course.
All thanks to Mr Richard Sodienye, the founder and director of BDLI, Nigeria LNG and The Youth Resource Center for this life changing opportunity in Tech.
